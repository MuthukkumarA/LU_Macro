Warning: Layer MRDL does not have a preferred direction, assigning to vertical. (ZRT-025)
Cell Min-Routing-Layer = M1
Cell Max-Routing-Layer = M6
Turn off antenna since no rule is specified
Information: Option route.detail.force_end_on_preferred_grid will be ignored since none of the layers have preferred grid. (ZRT-703)
Warning: Cannot find a default contact code for layer CO. (ZRT-022)
Info: number of net_type_blockage: 0 
Information: Via ladder engine would be activated for pattern must join connection in certain commands. Please refer to man-page for the command list. (ZRT-619)
Information: When applicable Min-max layer allow_pin_connection mode will allow paths of length 3.55 outside the layer range. (ZRT-707)
Information: When applicable Min-max layer allow_pin_connection mode will allow paths of length 3.55 outside the layer range on clock nets. (ZRT-718)
Information: When applicable layer based tapering will taper up to 0.00 in distance from the pin. (ZRT-706)
